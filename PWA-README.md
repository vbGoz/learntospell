## 🧪 Testing Offline Mode

1. **First Visit**: Open the app and wait for it to fully load

3. **Reload Page**: Page should still work (audio files cached on-demand)
4. **Real Offline**: Turn off WiFi and test the app

## ⚠️ Icon Setup Required

**IMPORTANT**: You need to create app icons before the PWA will install properly!

### Quick Icon Setup (5 minutes):

1. **Open** `generate-icons.html` in your browser
2. **Right-click** each canvas and save:
   - First canvas → Save as `icon-192.png`
   - Second canvas → Save as `icon-512.png`
3. **Place** both files in the root directory
4. **Commit** and push to GitHub

See `ICONS.md` for detailed icon creation instructions.

2. Must be served over HTTPS (GitHub Pages ✓)
3. Manifest must be valid (check DevTools → Application → Manifest)
4. Service worker must be registered (check DevTools → Application → Service Workers)

### Offline Not Working?
1. Visit app at least once while online
2. Wait for service worker to activate
3. Check cache in DevTools → Application → Cache Storage
4. Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Audio Not Playing Offline?
1. Audio files cached on first play
2. Play each word once while online to cache
3. Check audio cache: DevTools → Application → Cache Storage → `word-club-audio-v1`

### Updates Not Appearing?
1. Service worker checks every minute
2. Hard refresh to force update (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Unregister old service worker: DevTools → Application → Service Workers → "Unregister"
